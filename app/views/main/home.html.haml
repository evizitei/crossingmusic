  %h1 Welcome to The Crossing Music
  %p Welcome to The Crossing Music’s official website. The Crossing Music is made up by a team of staff, interns, and volunteers from the congregation of a church called The Crossing in Columbia, Missouri. We hope to have more for you here one day like some music, chords, and other resources.
  %p But for now, click on the “Songs” tab and check out some of our demos we’ve been working on. You can help us choose which songs we’ll record in a studio for our first little EP by rating them.
  %p Our goal for this project is to get some of the songs that have been written by our church into the hands of our church. We have little intention of doing much “promoting” outside of The Crossing and other churches we have relationships with. We want to be God glorifying, praying against little idols that often can step in to block our view of seeing and worshiping the Eternal King. We pray that the music, lyrics, and arrangements will help you to know our real God more and more.
  %p More to come!
